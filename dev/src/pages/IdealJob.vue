                As with many job listings in the IT industry, this listing was posted by a recruitment agency so the
                details are a little bit limited, but the role is to help support a software development project for an
                organisation in the federal government. The job is appealing to me because I have been interested in
                software development for a very long time and to turn my hobby into a career is a goal of mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The role requires experience with the .NET framework, as well as JavaScript frameworks and SQL
                databases. There are no required qualifications mentioned, however it does require general work-related
                skills such as being able
                to work autonomously, being able to work in teams, being able to communicate effectively with all
                involved personnel, and understanding of development life cycles and the Agile methodology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, all of my programming experience is within the scope of their requirements, however I don’t
                think they’re quite ready for job level as I still find myself getting stuck and looking for guidance.
                With C# being my
                primary programming language, the .NET framework is something I’m very familiar with, and in recent
                times I’ve been learning Vuejs which is a modern JavaScript framework that is also mentioned in the
                listing. I know some basic
                SQL from some applications I’ve made, but I’ve never needed to manage a big database so my skills are
                quite limited there. Hopefully after completing my studies, I can work in a graduate position to get
                some experience in a real
                working environment that I will then be able to transition into a role like this one.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe I currently have the skills to be able to work autonomously, and in a team, as that is a
                requirement for my current job. I don’t need to communicate with people who aren’t also in the industry
                in my current job, so being
                able to effectively convey messages to people who aren’t as technologically minded is something I would
                need to work on. Development life cycles and the Agile methodology are something I have come across, but
                not something I’ve ever
                looked into, so that is something I also will need to learn. I hope that through my studies I will be
                exposed to some of these methods and as well as developing the required communication skills.
