                My interest in IT started when I was relatively young. I grew up on a farm and was not the type of kid
                who enjoyed being outside and I was
                always looking for reasons to be inside. The family computer was the perfect outlet, even without
                internet I would spend hours using software
                like Paint and Microsoft Word just learning how they worked.

                I would say moving away from the farm and into the city and actually getting internet probably was the
                single most defining moment.
                Instead of wondering how things worked, I could easily find videos and guides in my pursuit to
                understand the technology I
                was interested in.

                With all the access to information, I found that programming became my primary interest. Being able to
                solve problems, manipulate data, store
                data, and display data has always been fascinating, and I enjoy learning about the many different ways
                that it can be done.
                Currently C# is my primary programming language.

                I would say I am pretty well versed with IT as it has been my primary interest for quite some time. I
                have experience setting up web servers,
                email servers, building and upgrading computers, as well as making websites and applications.
